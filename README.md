Hi, I am Pal Kiszel, undergraduate computer science student at University of Szeged, Hungary.

I have worked with microcontrollers, databases, web applications, image processing, artificial intelligence, kubernetes clusters and data analyzing so far.

I am interested in almost all the above fields and always looking for interesting options.
